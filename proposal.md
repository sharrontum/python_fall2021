# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hangman

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The game hangman where there is a word that the player will have to guess the letters in the word.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software would generate a random word from a premade dictionary that we will include. THe number of letters in the word would reflect to how many spaces for the letters will appear. The project would present the image of the stand from where the hangman would be drawn. The player will be able to input letters of the alphabet in order to guess the correct letters for the word. When the player inputs the wrong letter, a feature of the man will be drawn on the stand. Once the hangman is fully drawn, the player loses. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will accomplish the basics of the game as in having the correct spaces for the letters, the images of the hangman, and the aspect of winning and losing the game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of the final project would be to make the game look appealing. Making the images of the game look neat and eye-catching. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for the project would be to have all of the features of a regular game of hangman, having the game look neat and appealing to the eye, and maybe having the option of it being two player. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I believe the first part to create for the game is the randomizing words and inputting letters for the game. Creating the main aspect of the game where the player has to guess the right letters should be the most important part. Afterwards, we will need to draw the image of the stand and the hangman and making it so the image of the hangman is drawn in chronological order. I believe these two parts will be something Amy and I will collaborate together. Skills and topics that I would have to research is probably something to do with making the background/the hangman appealing to see like the background, colors, maybe a theme to the game.
