Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Decided the role that we have for the project. Amy will create a list and make a turtle to draw the blanks of each letter of the word. She will write a code that accepts the user's input and put the correct letter in the corresponding line. I will write a code to create the hangman and make it so with each incorrect letter, the turtle will draw the corresponding body part of the hangman.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Create the code for the user to input the correct letter and the corresponding output whether the user input the correct or incorrect letter. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None
