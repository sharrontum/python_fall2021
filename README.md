Overall, the final project was very enjoyable to complete. The project had many difficulties such as figuring out how to get the letters guessed onto the right blank and figuring out how to get the hangman to get drawn whenever there was an incorrect letter. I learned a lot more about coding and how to use turtle in order to write our code.
